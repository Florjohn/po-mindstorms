This repository contains software developed for a Computer Science course,
aiming to construct and program an autonomous Mindstorms robot, capable of
finding its way on a unknown track outlined by marker-lines and walls.
It's a group project I conducted with 5 fellow students:
- Michiel Huygen
- Florian
- Ruben Lepauw
- Daniel Denil
- Thomas 
- Christophe Van Ginneken

We have developed robot implementations for three demo's and one final
project. To try these implementations follow these instructions:

+ Get a copy of the Lejos SDK

Visit http://lejos.sourceforge.net/nxj-downloads.php and download an SDK for your environment. Unpack the SDK in a subdirectory alongside this repository.

./lejos_nxj
./po-mindstorms

+ Prepare bluetooth connections

Consult the Lejos documentation to setup a paired bluetooth connection between
your pc and your robot.

+ Build, upload and run the demo's

$ cd po-mindstorms/demos
$ make clean run PROJECT=demo1 NAME=robot-name

Follow the instructions on the screen of the robot.

$ cd po-mindstorms/demos
$ make clean run PROJECT=demo2 NAME=robot-name
$ cd ../console
$ make clean run PROJECT=demo2

Use the console GUI to start any of the three sub-demo's.

+ NetBeans

We have also provided an integrated NetBeans project in src/nbproject.
