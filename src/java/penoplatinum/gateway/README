To promote robustness, we don't connect our robot directly to any other
source. We want all components to be completely atomic and only serve one
goal. This also allows for easy reorganization to solve other problems. 

This strategy is reflected in the way we deal with the interaction with the robot. 

The different components are:

- Gateway (see src/java/penoplatinum/gateway)
	a small Java program that terminates the bluetooth connection and delivers
	all incoming packets to log4j and/or to an MQ Server

- log4j (see also: http://logging.apache.org/log4j/)
	is a general purpose logging framework, we use it to insert all incoming
	packets into a database and/or file. an example configuration is included

- central database (see also: http://mysql.com)
	we use a plain MySQL database server to store all packets.

- JBoss application server (see also: http://www.jboss.org/)
	to provide access to the recorded packets, we set up a standard application
	server that connects to the database and answers REST style queries.

- Dashboard (see src/java/penoplatinum/ui)
  our main user interface is a web-based client that can stream and replay
  recorded sessions through the REST interface or even a local generated file.
